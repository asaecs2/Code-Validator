# Code-Validator

This code sets up a Flask web application with three endpoints for validating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Each endpoint expects a POST request with corresponding code to validate. If validation fails, it returns a JSON response with errors and a status code of 400. If validation succeeds, it returns a success response with a status code of 200. The validation logic for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is left as placeholders in separate functions.
